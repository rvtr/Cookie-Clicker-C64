Cookie Clicker C64 (or CC64 for short) is a Cookie clicker clone for the Commodore 64.

## How to play : 

- Press the space bar to 'click' for cookies.

Credits: 
- [@Orteil](https://orteil.dashnet.org/) for making the original cookie clicker game
- [@drskinner](https://github.com/drskinner/) 

Notes: 
- Editing program lines larger than 80 characters on the C64 (or on an emulator) will result in parts of them being deleted
- `storedat`  must be placed in the same d64 as `cookie.prg`, or in the same directory, if your emulator treats a folder like a disk. Also note that unlike `storedat`, `savedat` is not needed to run the game, so you can place `savedat` on another d64 and swap disks when needed.
